# Finite Difference Solver

This folder contains methods for the finited difference solution of the non-linear potential flow equation on a 
body-fitted grid. Body- (or boundary-) fitted curvilinear coordinate systems provide an accurate representation of arbitrarily 
shaped bodies. The grid is the solution of an elliptic Partial Differential Equation (PDE) system.

The methods were not employed in the dissertation, but the implementation of the methods might be useful for someone
else.
